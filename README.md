To determine how many different Linux distributions the provided packages belong to, we analyze the listed dependencies:

1. **Dependencies in `deps.txt`**:
   - Includes standard Python packages like `python3`, `notebook`, `jupyter`, etc., which are typically part of common repositories such as `base`, `main`, or `Everything`.

2. **Dependencies in `package.json`**:
   - Lists projects like `sylphi-ai-platform` and other libraries, which may belong to various repositories.

Without knowing the exact repositories these packages are part of, it's impossible to count the number of distributions accurately. The packages might be from standard repos (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora) or custom ones. To get an accurate count, each package should be checked against known distros.

**Answer:** The provided information is insufficient to determine the exact number of Linux distributions these packages belong to. Additional data linking each package to specific repositories would be needed for a precise count.
